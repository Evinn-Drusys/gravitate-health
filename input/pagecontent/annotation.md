#### Mapping and Tagging Guidance
Choose a product label (in English), either an SmPC or PIL, upload to Teams and inform Jim. Jim will run the macro and upload the excel document into the same Teams folder. 

Note, for EU-CP products, the SmPC and PIL should be saved separately. 

Naming convention for Teams:

Product_LPD/PIL_Country (e.g. Xalkori_LPD_EUCP)

#### Guidance
##### Actions to take
Enter the relevant focus(s) into each cell. If there is no specific focus, then enter ‘All’. This will allow clear filtering and ensure that the review is not missed. 

If any of the text is unclear, or you are not sure what it is referring to, then check the original word label. 

Tables cannot be uploaded into an excel cell, so they will not be copied across and the word ‘Table’ with the wording of the first cell from that table will be added instead and highlighted yellow e.g. <Table> - First Cell contains: België/Belgique/Belgien. Refer to the original word label to check what the focuses are and assign these in the excel document accordingly. 

Images cannot be uploaded into an excel cell, so they will not be copied across and the word ‘Image’ will be added instead and highlighted yellow e.g. <Image>. Refer to the original word label to check what the focuses are and assign these in the excel document accordingly. 
There may be mini-sub-headings that are not clearly listed as headings (due to a lack of formatting) in the excel spreadsheet (e.g. Paediatric population). Any text underneath those ‘sub-headings’ MUST contain the same focuses as that sub-heading (e.g. Infant, Child focus assigned to both the heading and all text underneath the sub-heading). 

**For information - Headings**

The focuses for headings (defined section headings, e.g. Section 4.1) will highlighted with a light blue background and all focus columns will be pre-filled in as ‘All’ by the macro. These should not be changed. 

#### Explanation of Columns
##### Focus-Combined
This is an automatic roll-up of all focuses and will be used as an aid for filtering. **Do not touch, edit, or delete this cell.**

This column uses the following rules:
- Roll-up of all focuses
- Separate focuses are shown with a pipe | between 
- Clear focus is not rolled up
- If all fields are “All”, then “All” will be displayed
- If a field is “All”, but there are some focuses listed, then only the focuses will be shown
- The default will show as <tbd>. A focus must be added on every column before the information will populate

##### Clear Focus (Y/N)
Clear Focus is to determine whether the focus(es) to be assigned to text is clear. 

| Drop down Option | When to Use |
|--|--|
| Yes | If there is no ambiguity, enter Yes |
| No | If there is any ambiguity or it is unclear which focus should be assigned, enter No. If No has been added, then add a comment in the Clear Focus Comments column to explain why the text is not clear. |
| N/A | This will only be used for headings and will be pre-filled in by the macro. |
