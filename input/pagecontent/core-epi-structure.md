### FHIR Documents 
FHIR solutions are built from a set of modular components called "Resources". These resources can easily be assembled into working systems that solve real world clinical and administrative problems at a fraction of the price of existing alternatives.  

FHIR profile is a customized and more specific version of the base FHIR resources. In the context of this guidance, the profile the specific customizations and extensions made to the base FHIR resources needed to support ePIs. 

FHIR documents are a collection of resources bound together, and are transferred between systems as a Bundle resource.
